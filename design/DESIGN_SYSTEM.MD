## How to create a design system?

### Atomic Design (framework)

A way to break down the complexity into atomic particle that are easier to create

- Consists of:
  - atoms
  - molecules
  - organisms
  - templates
  - pages

#### Atom

Smallest unit that can exist on its own.

Ex: label, button, input, etc...

#### Molecule

Combination of atoms.

Ex. If we put the label, button and input together, we could have a:

- search bar
- login form

### Organism

Combination of molecules that can actually make sense to the user in a certain context.

Ex. Navbar, compromised of a search bar, set of link and a logo.

#### Templates

Are a combination of organisms. A layout or representation of what a page could be without using real data.

#### Page

A template with real data.
