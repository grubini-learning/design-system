# Semantic HTML

Use the tags for the job because they get all this accessibility and behaviors for free.

## Dont's

1. Use `<h\*>` tags in the correct order because screen readers navigate the website using the headings.
2. Don't use the `<a>` as a button, because if we remove the `href` attribute of the element the link becomes nothing.
3. Coding custom form controls

_If we have to use an element that is not semantic for the context, **MAKE IT BEHAVE LIKE THE RIGHT ELEMENT THAT IS SEMANTIC FOR THAT CONTEXT**_
