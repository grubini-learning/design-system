## Dont's

- DO NOT ðŸ›‘: Rely on color to convey meaning
- DO NOT ðŸ›‘: Have low color contrast

## Good practices

1. Have names next to color swatches if possible or convey colors meaning
2. âœ… Contrast ratio of 3 or higher, _we can try to increase font size to try to achieve this_

- Color and border on effects like hover

3. Categories of components that need to have **4.5:1** contrast
   - information bearing elements
     - text
     - images of text
     - standalone icons
   - Exceptions drop to 3:1
     - large text 14pt (bold) - 18pt (regular)
     - UI Controls
     - Graphical objects

- decorative and disabled elements (no contrast requirement)
  - disabled elements
  - photographs
  - logos
- aesthetic elements
  - background pattern
  - artistic border
